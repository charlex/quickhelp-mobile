# Quickhelp

A demo app for a React Native / Redux project.

## Getting started

Clone the project.

```
git clone git@diggit.trbprodcloud.com:quickpost/quickhelp-mobile.git
cd quickhelp-mobile
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```


Build and run the iOS app on the simulator:

```
npm run start-ios
```

Note: I recommend you kill the automatically started packager terminal tab and running it yourself so that you can easily restart it later:

```
npm run start
```
